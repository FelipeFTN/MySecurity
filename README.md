# MySecurity v2
We're working on a next version of MySecurity, which will be a lighter version, easy to run, and compiled.

It's currently working perfectly, but still in development.

You can download it and run on your computer by placing the binary file from _/MySecurity/bin_ on your system's startup folder.
## Compiling
You can compile your mySecurity source code using **make**. MySecurity compiling settings is all set up into _Makefile_, which is responsible by checking any change in source files and compiling it into a executable file that will be saved in */bin*.
If you want to build your MySecurity source code, just run: ```make``` into your terminal at MySecurity's root folder and the magic will be done.
