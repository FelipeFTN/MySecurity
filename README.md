# MySecurity

MySecurity is a simple program that allows you to access your computer from another device. It uses a web application to connect you with your computer, which were separated into _app_ and _api_.<br>

- _app_ controls all back-end computer functions (build in **C**)
- _api_ controls all the APIs and front-end functions (build in **Go**)

MySecurity is using two mainly programming languages to work, **Go** using some frameworks like [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) and a self-build Socket, and **C**
 using _Domain Driven Design_ and _Factory_ Design Patterns.
