# MySecurity v2
We're working on a next version of MySecurity, which will be a lighter version, easy to run, and compiled.

It's currently working perfectly, but still in development.

You can download it and run on your computer by placing the binary file from _/MySecurity/bin_ on your system's startup folder.
